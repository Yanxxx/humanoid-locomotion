# Humanoid Locomotion Research Project

This project is currently **under active development**.

The primary objective of this research is to **study learning-based humanoid locomotion algorithms**. We aim to explore and implement various techniques for enabling humanoid robots to move dynamically and efficiently using reinforcement learning.

## Prerequisites

To run and utilize this code, you will need to have **MuJoCo** installed. MuJoCo (Multi-Joint dynamics with Contact) is a physics engine that provides robust and accurate simulations essential for robotics research.

## Algorithms and Frameworks

The algorithms implemented in this project are built upon the following popular and powerful reinforcement learning frameworks:

* **Stable-Baselines3:** A set of reliable implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms in PyTorch.
* **Gymnasium:** A fork of OpenAI Gym, providing a standard API for reinforcement learning environments.

## Installation of Dependencies

You can install the necessary Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install stable-baselines3[extra] gymnasium
