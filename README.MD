## About The Project

The primary objective of this research is to explore, implement, and analyze various reinforcement learning algorithms for humanoid locomotion. By utilizing advanced physics simulations and powerful RL frameworks, we aim to develop robust and adaptive walking, running, and balancing behaviors for humanoid robots.

This repository contains the code for training and evaluating these agents in a simulated environment.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This project relies on the **MuJoCo** physics engine for accurate and efficient simulation of robotic dynamics.

- **MuJoCo Installation:**
  Please follow the official installation guide from DeepMind to set up MuJoCo on your system: [MuJoCo Documentation](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/humanoid-locomotion-research.git](https://github.com/your_username/humanoid-locomotion-research.git)
    cd humanoid-locomotion-research
    ```
2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    This project uses `pip` for package management. We recommend using a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    pip install stable-baselines3[extra] gymnasium jax jaxlib
    ```

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, you can begin training and evaluating the reinforcement learning agents.

* **To train a new model:**
    ```bash
    python train.py --agent PPO --env Humanoid-v4
    ```

* **To evaluate a pre-trained model:**
    ```bash
    python evaluate.py --agent PPO --model_path /path/to/your/model.zip
    ```

*For a full list of available arguments and environments, please refer to the documentation or run the scripts with the `--help` flag.*

## Roadmap

-   [ ] Implement Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE).
-   [ ] Integrate JAX for high-performance, parallel simulations.
-   [ ] Benchmark performance against existing locomotion controllers.
-   [ ] Develop and test on a custom humanoid robot model.
-   [ ] Explore sim-to-real transfer techniques.
